## Matricies

*From 08 September, 2021*

This code is a custom function in MATLAB that creates a custom matrix from two values. The function can be called by `specialMatrix(n,m)` where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns desired. Each cow/column starts with 1 and counts up by 1 until the nth/mth term. The rest of the values are each equal to the sum of the element directly about and to the left of it in the matrix. If more or less than 2 inputs are added to the command, an error message is displayed and the function will not run. The purpose of this was to practice creating custom functions and writing custom errors.

The new functions/commands introduced and used are  `error`, `:`, `zeros()`, and `~=`. This also includes matrix element referencing and replacing. The code itself also contains comments to describe the process as it runs.
