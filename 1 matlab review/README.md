The purpose of these two algorithms is to practice simple matlab built-in functions. 

## Simple Electric Circuit

The first code was used to make a plot and subplot of an equation for the charge on an rlc circuit. This includes the use of `plot`, `subplot`, `title`, `xlabel`, `ylabel`, `title`, and `linspace`.

The following image is the resulting graphs:

## Degredation of Aqueous Bromide

This code makes a plot from data sets and combines two sets of data on one graph. This includes the functions `plot`, `hold on`, `hold off`, `title`, `xlabel`, `ylabel`, and `legend`. It also uses code to change the appearance of the graph as well. 

The following image is the resulting graph:
