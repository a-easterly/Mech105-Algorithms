# Mech105-Algorithms

***This repository contains all algorithms created for Mech-105, Fall 2021, with MATLAB using different numerical methods.***

Each section has the code used, a more in-depth description, and the original date of creation.

 Algorithm Title              | Description
-------------------------- | ----------
**Matlab Review**  | Uses basic MATLAB functions for two codes; one for a simple electric circuit and the other for the degredation of aqueous solutions
**Decisions** | Uses logic in MATLAB to make decisions, specfically for volume of a tank
**Matricies** | Creates special matrix in MATLAB from any number for rows and columns
**Root Finding** | Uses built in MATLAB functions to find the root of a a function
**Linear Algebra** | Solves linear factorization problems with partial pivoting and lower/upper factorization
**Simpson's 1/3** | Solves integrals numerically using the Simpcon's 1/3 rule and trapezoidal rule if needed
