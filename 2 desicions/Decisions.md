## Decisions

This algorithm uses logic in MATLAB to solve for the volume of a liquid in a tank that has a radiud that increases linearly by height after a certain level in the tank *(image1)*. This code highlights the functions `if`, `else`, and`fprintf` and operaters such as `<=` `>` `>=` etc. 

The tank used in this code:
