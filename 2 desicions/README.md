This algorithm uses logic in MATLAB to solve for the volume of a liquid from the height in a tank that has a radius that increases linearly by height after a certain level in the tank *(image1)*. This makes finding the volume at any time simpler, as only one number (height) has to be changed, instead of re-writing the entire work by hand. This code highlights the functions `if`, `else`, and`fprintf` and operaters such as `<=` `>` `>=` etc. 

The tank used in this code:
